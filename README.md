# airplane-simulation

This is a project based on JavaScript and WebGL library, allows to control the simulation of an airplane and also implements terrain generation. This project was implemented in the Computer Graphics and Interfaces course.

# How to use it

It allows the user to control:

- The yaw by controlling the rudder: Use the "Q" and "E" keys
- The pitch by controlling the elevators: Use the "W" and "S" keys
- The roll by controlling the ailerons: Use the "A" and "D" keys
- The propulsion by controlling the rotation speed of the engines/propellers: Use the "R" and "F" keys

The view can be observed by one of the 4 pre-defined cameras associated to the airplane position:

- Top view: Use the "1" key
- Lateral view: Use the "2" key
- Front view: Use the "3" key
- Chase view (default): Use the "0" key

We can observe the shape of the airplane as (Use the "O" key to alternate):

- Painted surfaces
- Wired shaped
